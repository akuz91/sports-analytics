`baseball`: Using event-level data pitching statistics (ie. walks, strikeouts, etc) to develop features proposed by McCracken [1] and predict next year's statistics. Using pitch-by-pitch data, improve performance of model built on event-level data, and predict whether a pitch will be a called strike or swinging strike. 

`soccer`: Using high-level game data to perform analysis on goal differentials and goal scoring distributions. Feature engineering to aid in prediction of game outcome. Compute elo and dfl/massey ratings and predict soccer game outcome. Using detailed shot-level data to enhance models and improve game outcome predictions.
